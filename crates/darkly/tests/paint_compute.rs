//! The `paint` terminal as a compute pass: one dispatch per dab against a
//! packed `r32uint` ground that is the stroke scratch itself
//! (`crates/darkly/src/brush/nodes/paint.rs`, plan
//! `docs/plans/compute-paint-terminal.md`).
//!
//! The accumulation laws are pinned exactly by `tests/brush_accumulation.rs`
//! and the pixels against the recorded dispatch spike by
//! `tests/paint_dispatch_spike.rs`; what is here is the framework plumbing
//! the port touches: the ground through the checkpoint ring's rewinds, the
//! `dispatches` counter, the selection under a cropped canvas, the ground
//! through a mid-stroke layer grow, and the one behaviour the per-dab
